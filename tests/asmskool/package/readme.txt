Hi everyone.

This is a port of code school tut46 from scoopex / photon.
as we all know AmigaONE's don't have chipset, 
but I'm working project to solve that, copper software rendering.
as demonstration, I decided to make this port of 
this non system friendly / hardware banging demo, 
just to prove anything is possible.

Are you interested yet?? Well, the copper rendering project can be found her:
https://github.com/khval/libcopper.library

This project also uses
ptreplay.libary, ptplay.library and libblitter.library

Don't worry they are included, copy this files to libs:

For more info about code school read SAMSKOOL_READ.txt file included.

Fixes, from last update...

* Feil to open libs bug, crash.
* Missing ptplay.library
* some typos, here and there.
