composing music - these involved no code changes. Ep. 29 is standalone, to show 
how to play music in any program, available here:

missing or corrupt.

>> To build the demo these tutorials made, assemble Tut47.S.

The code is written for any* AsmOne, AsmTwo, AsmPro, Thrash'm-One and Seka 
version. Please use one of these if you are learning, because it will make 
progress smoother. It's written case insensitive and Label:, and the EVEN 
directive corresponds to CNOP 0,2 in most assemblers.
